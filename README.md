# Camera-Product-Survery-Analysis
This is the analysis of a product survey for a recording device.

Please be sure to read the .txt survey questions to properly understand the purpose of the survey to guide your analysis.

Also keep your version of the .ipnyb file in the same directory as the .csv file to avoid having to add a directory path in your pd.read_csv() method.

The data was collated automatically using google forms, so there was much need for cleaning. I have done a basic preparation on the dataframe, to get everyone working
on the same page.
